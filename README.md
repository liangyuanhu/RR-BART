# RR-BART We propose an inference-based method, called RR-BART, which leverages the likelihood-based Bayesian machine learning technique,
# Bayesian additive regression trees, and uses Rubin's rule to combine the estimates and variances of the variable importance measures on 
# multiply imputed datasets for variable selection in the presence of MAR data. 
# The accompanying paper Lin et al. (2022) "A flexible approach for variable selection in large-scale healthcare database studies with 
# missing covariate and outcome data"  BMC Medical Research Methodology 22, 132.
